## 2023
**May**: I will be attending the [Optimal transport in Data Science](https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-23-otds/) at ICERM. I will be presenting a poster on our recent work on the *Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling*.

**April**: Excited to announce new preprint titled [A Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13534). This joint work with Markos Katsoulakis. We show that flow and diffusion-based generative models, including normalizing flows, score-based models, and Wasserstein gradient flows can be derived from a single unifying mean-field games framework. 

**February**: I am the creator and organizer of the [Learning *Learning*](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/seminars/learning-learning-seminar). This is a seminar for students and postdocs to present their in-progress research, and practice giving research presentations. 

Announced  new preprint titled [Transport map unadjusted Langevin algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07227). This joint work with Youssef Marzouk and Konstantinos Spiliopoulos. We show that Langevin algorithms applied to target distributions that are preconditioned with a normalizing transport map can accelerate sampling and are related to reversible perturbations of Langevin dynamics. 

## 2022

**September**: I will be presenting at [SIAM MDS 2022]() in the minisymposium on *Frontiers in Monte Carlo Methods for Physics*. My talk will be about our work on the *Transport map unadjusted Langevin algorithm*.

Our paper on [Geometry-informed irreversible perturbations for accelerated convergence of Langevin dynamics] was accepted for publication in [Statistics and Computing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-022-10147-6). 

I joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at UMass Amherst as a postdoctoral research associate. 

**April**: I am co-organizing a minisymposium at [SIAM UQ 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq22) titled [Data-Driven Approaches to Rare and Extreme Events](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=73425), in which I will be presenting our work on *Data-driven methods for rare event simulation in stochastic dynamical systems.*

**February**: Attending the [Data Assimilation - Mathematical Foundations and Applications](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2208/www_view) workshop at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 20-26. 

**January**: Our paper on [A Koopman framework for rare event simulation in stochastic differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07330) was accepted for publication in the [Journal for Computational Physics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999122000870). 


## 2021
**December**
I successfully defended my PhD thesis on December 13!

 Presented a [poster](https://benjzhang.github.io/files/icbinb_poster.pdf) on our _Sampling via Controlled SDEs_ work at the [ICBINB workshop at NeurIPS2021](https://i-cant-believe-its-not-better.github.io/neurips2021/), December 13.
