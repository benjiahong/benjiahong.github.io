**April 2022**: I am co-organizing a minisymposium at [SIAM UQ 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq22) titled [Data-Driven Approaches to Rare and Extreme Events](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=73425), in which I will be presenting our work on *Data-driven methods for rare event simulation in stochastic dynamical systems.*

**February 2022**: Attending the [Data Assimilation - Mathematical Foundations and Applications](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2208/www_view) workshop at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 20-26.
