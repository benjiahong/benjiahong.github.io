## 2024

**May**: Excited to announce two new preprints! In [Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15754), we prove SGM generalization bounds in terms of integral probability metrics using regularity theory of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and an novel uncertainty propagation perspective. This is joint work with [Nikiforos Mimikos-Stamatopoulos](https://math.uchicago.edu/~nmimikos/) and [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). 


In [Nonlinear denoising score matching for enhanced learning of structured distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15625), we propose SGMs with *nonlinear* forward processes, which produces structure-preserving generative models. A nonlinear implementation of denoising score-matching is developed to facilitate the use of nonlinear processes. This is joint work with [Jeremey Birrell](https://people.umass.edu/jbirrell/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/), and [Wei Zhu](https://people.math.umass.edu/~zhu/). 

**February**: I am co-organizing a minisymposium at [SIAM UQ 2024](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq24) titled [Optimal Transport for Uncertainty Quantification](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78505) with [Panagiota Birmpa](https://sites.google.com/site/panagiotabirmpa/home). I will also be presenting in the [Computational Transport](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78494) minisymposium  where I will be presenting on our recent work relating mean-field games with generative modeling. 


I am excited to announce our new preprint title [Wasserstein proximal operators describe score-based generative models and resolve memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06162). We show that score-based generative models can be fundamentally understood as the Wasserstein proximal operator of cross-entropy and we build informed models that resolve the memorization phenomenon in SGMs. This is joint work with [Siting Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/siting6ucla/home), [Wuchen Li](https://people.math.sc.edu/wuchen/), [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/), and [Stan Osher](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sjo/). 

## 2023


**November**: 
I will be giving a talk at [NYU Shanghai](https://dail.shanghai.nyu.edu/events/mean-field-games-laboratory-generative-modeling) on our recent work *Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling.*


**October**: 
I will be visiting [Emory University](http://www.math.emory.edu/site/codes/) and speaking in their [Computational and data-enabled science seminar series](http://www.math.emory.edu/site/codes/schedule/). 


I gave a talk on our work *Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling* to the [Machine Learning and Mean Field Games Seminar series](https://sites.google.com/view/mlmfgseminar/home)

**June**: I gave a talk on our work *Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling* to the UCLA Level Set Collective. 


**May**: I will be attending the [Optimal transport in Data Science](https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-23-otds/) at ICERM. I will be presenting a poster on our recent work on the *Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling*.

**April**: Excited to announce new preprint titled [A Mean-Field Games Laboratory for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13534). This joint work with Markos Katsoulakis. We show that flow and diffusion-based generative models, including normalizing flows, score-based models, and Wasserstein gradient flows can be derived from a single unifying mean-field games framework. 

**February**: I am the creator and organizer of the [Learning *Learning*](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/seminars/learning-learning-seminar). This is a seminar for students and postdocs to present their in-progress research, and practice giving research presentations. 

Announced new preprint titled [Transport map unadjusted Langevin algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07227). This joint work with Youssef Marzouk and Konstantinos Spiliopoulos. We show that Langevin algorithms applied to target distributions that are preconditioned with a normalizing transport map can accelerate sampling and are related to reversible perturbations of Langevin dynamics. 

## 2022

**September**: I will be presenting at [SIAM MDS 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds22) in the minisymposium on *Frontiers in Monte Carlo Methods for Physics*. My talk will be about our work on the *Transport map unadjusted Langevin algorithm*.

Our paper on [Geometry-informed irreversible perturbations for accelerated convergence of Langevin dynamics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-022-10147-6) was accepted for publication in *Statistics and Computing*. 

I joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at UMass Amherst as a postdoctoral research associate. 

**April**: I am co-organizing a minisymposium at [SIAM UQ 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq22) titled [Data-Driven Approaches to Rare and Extreme Events](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=73425), in which I will be presenting our work on *Data-driven methods for rare event simulation in stochastic dynamical systems.*

**February**: Attending the [Data Assimilation - Mathematical Foundations and Applications](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2208/www_view) workshop at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 20-26. 

**January**: Our paper on [A Koopman framework for rare event simulation in stochastic differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07330) was accepted for publication in the [Journal for Computational Physics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999122000870).
