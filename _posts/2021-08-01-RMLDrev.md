This post connects Riemannian manifold Langevin dynamics with reversible pertrubations to generators of Langevin dynamics. 


Quick review of Riemannian manifold Langevin dynamics
===

Let $\pi(x)$ be a target probability density on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Riemannian manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) has been presented as a better proposal for the MALA than standard Langevin dynamics (LD) \cite{girolami2011}. Let $X_t$ be a diffusion evolving according to the stochastic differential equation (SDE)
\begin{align}
   dX_t = \frac{1}{2}G^{-1}(X_t) \nabla \log \pi(X_t) \,dt + \frac{1}{2}\Omega(X_t) \, dt + \sqrt{G^{-1}(X_t)} \, dW_t
\end{align}
where $G(X_t)$ is the Riemmanian metric, which is a $d\times d$ positive-definite matrix, $W_t$ is a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\Omega(x)$ is a vector-valued function defined entry-wise as follows:
\begin{align} 
  \Omega_i(x) = |G(x)|^{-1/2} \sum_{j = 1}^d \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[(G^{-1})_{ij} (x) |G(x)|^{1/2}\right]. 
\end{align}
Here $|\cdot|$ denotes the determinant. In \cite{girolami2011}, the authors argue that using the Fisher information matrix will help with choosing $G(x)$. Some intuition for why using LD as a proposal for MCMC is attractive partially stems from the fact that LD has $\pi$ as its invariant density. It was noted in \cite{xifara2014}, however, that the invariant density of the RMLD presented above is not $\pi$! While the distribution it converges to is $\pi(\cdot)$, the density it samples from is defined with respect to the measure defined on the manifold! In fact, on $\mathbb{R}^d$, RMLD has invariant density $\pi^*(x) = \pi(x) |G(x)|^{1/2}$, and the note \cite{xifara2014} corrects RMLD so that it has $\pi(x)$ as its invariant density. We will walk through the steps for deriving the corrected version of RMLD in the sequel.
